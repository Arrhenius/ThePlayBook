# ThePlayBook


The purpose of the tool that is being created is to allow players involved in a Counter Strike Global Offensive match
to be able to draw strategies on a canvas that everyone can see during a pause at freeze time. Currently the only
methods used amongst semi professionals and professionals involves bringing a notebook with predefined team strats or even
using Google Docs. This seems to me as an outdated method of doing things and plan on creating this tool with the intention 
of allowing an overlay to appear from within the game that allows the team as a whole to see strategies discussed in real 
time on a canvas versus waiting for the in-game leader to remember every possible thing and then verbally expressing what 
play will be executed.


## Development

Currently I can not guarantee anything will run for you at this time, anything that happens to run also happens to have many features
disabled for debugging purposes and any attempt to run this on your system will probably involve small hacks if they happen to be needed.


The development of this tool is done on my free time (which is scarce) and due to that, is currently using the most unreliable approach:
the code and fix method. For now this will be my initial approach just to get to a beta stage and then refactor the tool and
give it an appropriate design. Part of the reasoning behind this is I am also learning how to use ImGui and DirectX9 features so it
is not really possible for me to engineer a really nice tool correctly the first time while I am still learning how to use other
libraries and their capabilities as well. As my understanding of these libraries grows I will then at some point be able to refactor 
the tool and design it accordingly.
