This is a simple text file where I will display my thoughts on the design of the software,
design ideas, and anything else I may come up with that I want to be in the software.


Goal:
	To be able to create simple plays of a strategy that will be played out
	in a Counter Strike Global Offensive match. To be able to share new ideas on
	a canvas using paint like tools and predefined buttons. You can save a variety
	of these plays and create your own playbook for your team.

	Initial goals will be:
		-able to try and read in an image of the map that displays it on a canvas.
		-Login to an account
		-Be able to draw on the canvas
		-save that
